# Release Notes for v3 2.0.0 [2025 March 1]

Today, we’re shipping one new release:

**xUnit.net Core Framework v3 2.0.0**
It’s been 3 weeks since the release of [1.1.0 RTM](https://xunit.net/releases/v3/1.1.0).

As always, we’d like to thank all the users who contributed to the success of xUnit.net through usage, feedback, and code contributions.

These release notes are a list of changes from `1.1.0` to `2.0.0`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This release contains breaking changes as indicated by the major version bump. Binary compatibility with `1.x.y` packages is not guaranteed, and extensibility projects should verify whether these breaking changes affect them as they may be required to issue new versions.
